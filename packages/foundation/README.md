# Foundation

This package will be responsible for providing all the foundational elements we will need to build components and products with our teams.

Briefly, we will touch upon:

- Creating design tokens based on our Figma design system file.
- Generating asset files (CSS, SCSS, JS) from design tokens with Style Dictionary.
- Creating a Tailwind preset that other consumers (external or internal) can use based on the generated tokens.

## Scripts

- `yarn workspace @brunogarcia/foundation-ds run build-tokens`: Build the package.
